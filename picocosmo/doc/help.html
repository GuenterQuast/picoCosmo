Short description of  </span><span style=" font-size:xx-large; font-weight:600;">picoCosmo  </span></p>

<p>
This software is tailored to identify short pulses from muon detectors,  
e. g. the scintillator panels of the  
<span style=" font-style:italic;">CosMO</span>-experiment by &quot;Netzwerk Teilchenwelt&quot;,
<a href="http://www.teilchenwelt.de"><span style=" text-decoration: underline; color:#0057ae;">
http://www.teilchenwelt.de</span></a>, or the 
<span style=" font-style:italic;"> Kamiokanne</span>-Experiment (a water cherenkov detector
with photomultiplier readout).</p>

<p>
Data is read from the PicoScope device via a Buffer Manager, which collects
recorded waveforms and distributes them to consumer processes. The consumers
either provide real-time displays of a sub-set of the data or perform data analysis.</p>
 
<p>
The analysis proceeds in three steps. 
First, the trigger is validated by cross-correlation with a signal template located
around the trigger time. Next, coincidences near a validated triggering
pulse are searched for in all connected channels. The optional third step performs 
a search for additional pulses after the triggering event, indicating the decay of a
stopped muon in or near the detector. </p>
 
<p>
The software provides real-time displays of waveforms, detector signals and rates. 
Optionally, parameters of identified pulses or of double-pulses are written to 
files in <span style="font-family:'Hack';">CSV</span> format. 
In addition, raw waveforms or pictures in <span style="font-family:'Hack';">.png</span> 
format of identified double pulses can optionally  be stored for off-line analysis
or for an instructive analysis &quot;by hand&quot; based on the waveform pictures. 
From this information, the mean muon lifetime in the muon rest frame (2.2 Âµs) can
be derived.

<span style=" font-size:x-large; font-weight:600;">Configuration and program execution</span></p>
 
<p>
Data Acquisition and Analysis is started using the graphical interface by typing 
<span style=" font-family:'Hack';">./CosmoGui.py xxx.daq</span>, or optionally, by
directly starting the pyhton script for run execution with the command 
<span style=" font-family:'Hack';">./runCosmo xxxx.daq</span>.</p>

<p>
The configuration for <span style=" font-family:'Hack';">runCosmo.py</span> 
is defined in several '.yaml' files contained in sub-directory
<span style=" font-family:'Hack';">config/</span>. 

The configuration files applicable to a specific experimental set-up are
listed in files of type  <span style=" font-family:'Hack';">.daq</span>, 
e.g. <span style=" font-family:'Hack';">Kanne.daq</span> for Kamiokanne and 
<span style=" font-family:'Hack';">Cosmo.daq</span> for a run with the CosMo panels.</p>

<p>
The  <span style=" font-family:'Hack';">.yaml</span> files specify configurations for the
oscilloscope, the BufferManager and the Pulse Filter. Here is the example to run with
Kamiokanne:</p>

<p><span style=" font-family:'Hack';"># file Kanne.daq --------------------<br/>
# configuration files for Kamiokanne<br/>
DeviceFile: config/PMpulse.yaml   # Oscilloscope configuration<br/>
BMfile:     config/BMconfig.yaml  # Buffer Manager configuration<br/>
PFfile:     config/PFKanne.yaml  # Pulse Filter Configuration</span></p>

<p>
These configuration files are loaded into the Configuration tab at program start.</p>

<p>The graphical interface allows to inspect and modify the configuration and to start
a data acquitistion run by starting the script 
<span style=" font-family:'Hack';">runComso.py</span> as a subprocess. 
Configuration and output files are stored in a newly created directory
<span style=" font-family:'Hack';">&lt;Run Tag&gt;_&lt;date&gt;/</span>, 
where a specific <span style=" font-family:'Hack';">&lt;Run Tag&gt;</span> 
can be specified by the user.</p>

<p>
After run start, control is performed via the main window of the Buffer
Manager, which contains the options 
<span style=" font-family:'Hack';">Pause</span>, 
<span style=" font-family:'Hack';">Resume</span>,
<span style=" font-family:'Hack';">Stop</span> and 
<span style=" font-family:'Hack';">EndRun</span>. 

In stopped state, all windows remain open, so that graphs may be saved and log
output inspected. In End-state, all processes are stopped, and consequently all
windows disappear. Resume running from Stop-state is presently not foreseen.</p>
